While the optimal solution is costly, it is only required to be computed for network states in the training set. During test time, the GNN adequately learns how to compute the OPF solution. Numerical experiments are run on the IEEE-30 and IEEE-118 test cases.","tags":[],"title":"Optimal Power Flow Using Graph Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Damian Owerko","Fernando Gama","Alejandro Ribeiro"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541030400,"objectID":"648cede0dc0b7a1c9a2123afc51bde9b","permalink":"https://damowerko.github.io/publication/globalsip2018/","publishdate":"2018-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/globalsip2018/","section":"publication","summary":"We deploy novel graph neural networks to adequately process weather measurements in order to determine the likelihood of a power outage.
